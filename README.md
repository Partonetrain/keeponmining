# KeepOnMining

If you don't break a block instantly, then there is a 5-tick cooldown between breaking a block and starting to break the next one.
This mod simply makes this cooldown configurable, with the delay being set to 0 by default.
The delay can be changed any time in-game by accessing the mod's config menu.

This mod will do nothing if installed on a dedicated server.

## Warning
This is a purely client-side mod, but server software can detect that you're breaking blocks faster than you should be able to.
Only use this mod on servers that explicitly allow it. I am not responsible for any punishments doled out by server admins as a result of using this mod.

### Q: Why is this a whole mod / why isn't this just a feature in Train's Tweaks?
A: Firstly, there are already mods which achieve this on Fabric 1.21, but not on NeoForge. Since I want all Train's Tweaks features to work near-identically on both platforms and there's no reason to implement it on Fabric, a new mod for NeoForge is the answer.
Second, since servers may consider this mod cheating, a single mod makes the cause easier to identify.
Third, this mod can easily work on all 1.21 versions with the same jar, but the same can't be said for all the tweaks in my other mod.
